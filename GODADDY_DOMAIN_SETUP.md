## How to register a domain name with GoDaddy

1. Enter the domain name in GoDaddy's domain name search bar.

2. Click Add to Cart.
   
3. If desired, register additional extensions to protect your online brand. Click Add to Cart for each additional domain name.

4. Click Continue to Cart.

5. Select a domain privacy plan, or click No Thanks.

## Find DNS Management or Name Server Settings

Under Domains, you’ll see a list of domain names you’ve purchased from GoDaddy. Select the domain name you’d like to connect to your hosting account and click Manage.

You will take you to the control panel page where you can manage that specific domain name. On this page, you can also view information related to your domain name i.e. when it will be automatically renewed. Having mentioned auto-renewals, we should make a reminder:

If you don’t renew your domain before the expiration date, someone else might take them.
