## How to register a domain name with GoDaddy

1. Visit [GoDaddy.com](https://www.godaddy.com/uk-ua)
   
Open up your preferred browser and go to [GoDaddy.com](https://www.godaddy.com/uk-ua). Once the home page loads, you’ll see a search bar where you can begin your domain search.

2. Enter the domain name in GoDaddy's domain name search bar.

5. Click Continue to Cart.

6. Select a domain privacy plan, or click No Thanks.

7. Sign into your GoDaddy account or click Create Account.
   You’ll be prompted to enter your billing and payment information. GoDaddy offers several payment methods so choose the one that’s most convenient for you. You will need to provide your billing address but if you’ve chosen domain privacy in the previous step, that information will not be visible to the public.

8. Review your order under My Items and click Complete Purchase.
   Consider registering your domain name for a longer term to save money in the long run and prevent accidental domain expiration.

9. Sign into your GoDaddy account and go to settings under "My products", in the list of products find your newly created domain and click on the management button
10. On the page you went to on the right, there is a domain management button, click it and on the next page go to the DNS tab, where you need to create DNS records
