You will take you to the control panel page where you can manage that specific domain name. On this page, you can also view information related to your domain name i.e. when it will be automatically renewed. Having mentioned auto-renewals, we should make a reminder:

If you don’t renew your domain before the expiration date, someone else might take them.
